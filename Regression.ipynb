    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for part 1 of Assignment 3, where we perform an empirical study using linear regression. We have chosen to conduct the empirical study on the `Vehicle Dataset` from Kaggle, which contains 4340 observations describing used cars that were being sold on an online platform for used car sales, called CarDehko. Thus, our goal is to predict the selling price of used cars using linear regression based on the features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by describing the dataset and performing an initial exploration to provide context on the data we are working with. Then, we clean the data using the validity checks from Assignment 2. Please run these cells in order, as each check builds on the previous one to make sure that the dataset is progressively validated and cleaned as errors are encountered. If a validity check from Assignment 2 does not apply to our dataset, we provide a brief explanation as to why we have chosen to exclude it. Next, we perform categorical feature encoding to transform all the relevant categorical features into one-hot encoded numerical features such that they can be used in the linear regression model. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets, since we only want to apply outlier detection and feature engineering to the training set (as the test set should remain \"unseen\"). Then, we perform outlier detection and deletion with the goal of improving the model performance (which we check in a later step). This is followed by an exploration of the `LinearRegression` method in `scikit-learn` which will be used in a subsequent step. Next, we perform feature engineering to attempt to enrich our analysis (on both the original training set and the training set with outliers removed). Finally, we compare the performance of the following four models that we constructed using cross validation on the training set:\n",
    "- Default model (no outlier removal nor feature engineering),\n",
    "- Model with outlier removal (no feature engineering),\n",
    "- Model with feature engineering (no outlier removal),\n",
    "- Model with outlier removal and feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon choosing the model that has the best validation performance, we apply it to the test set and analyze the results.\n",

    "**Purpose:** The dataset consists of features of used cars. One purpose of the dataset is to allow users to practice linear regression to predict car prices, as described on Kaggle. However, it does not appear that the dataset has one original purpose, it can be used for many car-related applications. <br>\n",
    "**Shape:** There are 4340 rows and 8 columns. (4340, 8)<br>\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "- `name` (categorical): The name of the car, including the car brand and the model name and variants.\n",
    "- `year` (numerical): The year that the car was manufactured.\n",
    "- `selling_price` (numerical): The price of the car.\n",
    "- `km_driven` (numerical): The number of kilometres that the car has been driven.\n",
    "- `fuel` (categorical): The fuel type of the car, which can be petrol, diesel, CNG, LPG or electric.\n",
    "- `seller_type` (categorical): The type of the seller, which can be either an individual or a dealer.\n",

This is important, as we do not want to remove outliers from or add features to the test set. We should only be modifying the training set. We will perform the split on the encoded DataFrame.\n",

Note that we will use 4-fold cross validation on the training set in a later step, which will involve creating 4 validation sets from the training set that we define in this section. So, we do not separate a validation set in this step (as specified by the professor).\n",

The `contamination` parameter allows us to set the proportion of outliers in the dataset. Although we do not know the exact proportion of outliers in the dataset, a fairly small proportion of the data appeared to be outlying in the EDA section, so we set `contamination` to a low value of 0.01."

    "We explore the `LinearRegression` method in scikit-learn. As expected, it minimizes the residual sum of squares between the predicted values and the actual values of the target in order to obtain the coefficients of a linear model. Note that all the default parameters are suitable for our situation. It has an attribute `coef_` which provides the estimated coefficients of the linear model. In order to fit the model, we must run `fit` on the instance of `LinearRegression`, and pass in the training data and the target values. We run `predict` on the instance of `LinearRegression` to obtain the predictions for our target feature.\n",

    "We construct two additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is created using aggregation and ratios; we compute the ration between the number of kilometers driven by a car and the average number of kilometers driven by cars from that year. Our intuition behind this feature is that in recent years, people upgrade to new cars more frequently than in the past, so it is possible that older cars were designed to last greater wear and tear. So, an older car could have a higher number of kilometers driven but be in similar shape as a newer car with a lower number of kilometers driven, due to their design. Thus, we create a feature that compares a car's kilometers driven to the average number of kilometers driven in that year, where a value greater than 1 suggests that the car is in worse shape than average (has traversed more kilometers) and a value less than 1 suggests that the car is in better shape than average (has traversed less kilometers). Thus, this could provide context on the selling price of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature is created using time differences; we compute the average time the car was owned by each of its owners. If a car has been resold many times in a short span of time, it is possible that there is some defect or issue with the car that is causing people to pass it off, warranting a lower price. On the other hand, if the owners of the car have had it for a longer time, it is likely that the car was well-maintained to last that time, warranting a higher price. So, we believe this feature could be useful in the prediction. To calculate this value, we compute the difference between the year which the car is being sold (the present) and the year of the car to determine its age. Based on the Kaggle description of the dataset, the temporal coverage end date of the dataset is 06/26/2020, so we consider the \"present\" year to be 2020. Then, we divide the age by the number of owners the car has had. Note that if the car has had 4 owners or more, we divide by 4, as this is our best approximation to how many owners that car had. Also note that we count test drive cars as having one owner because they were owned only by the entity selling the car.\n",

    "We decide to use MSE and R-squared as our evaluation metrics, which are both commonly used evaluation metrics in the context of regression. R-squared indicates what proportion of the variation in `selling_price` can be explained by the model, i.e. by the variation of the predictors. So, we are aiming for a high value of R-squared. In other words, we want the R-squared value to be close to 1 since it ranges from 0 to 1. MSE quantifies how far our predictions are from the true values. It penalizes large errors more drastically due to the square. So, we are aiming for a low value of MSE (as close to 0 as possible). Note that `scikit-learn` uses negative MSE (`neg_mean_squared_error`), which is simply MSE multiplied by -1, so we multiply the scores we obtain by -1.\n",

This means that only about 44% of the variation in the selling price can be explained by the predictors in the model, which is not ideal. The value of MSE is also very large, which is in part due to the large magnitude of the selling prices, but also due to errors in our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with outlier removal (with no feature engineering) achieved an average cross validation R-squared score of 0.50 and MSE score of approximately 8.01 x 10^10. So, about 50% of the variation in the selling price can be explained by the predictors in the model, which is not an extremely high proportion, but it is a fairly decent improvement (6% increase) from the default model. We believe that the difference in R-squared scores can be attributed to the outliers introducing greater variability that is harder to capture with the predictors. So, removing the outliers results in data that follows a more consistent pattern, making it easier for the model to learn the pattern using the predictors. Similarly, while the MSE score remains fairly large, it is noticeably lower than the default model, suggesting a good improvement. We believe that the difference in MSE scores between this model and the default model can be attributed to the extreme values of the outliers. Since the outlying observations have more extreme values than inlying observations, the magnitude of a prediction error for an outlying value is likely to be greater than the magnitude of a prediction error for an inlying value. We know that MSE penalizes large errors more heavily, resulting in a lower MSE when outliers are removed. We also note that the standard deviations for the cross validation estimates for this model are lower than for the default model, suggesting that we are more confident in the estimates for this model.\n",

These scores are slightly better than the default model. However, the scores of the default model are within a standard deviation from the scores of this model. So, we conclude that their performances are comparable. This suggests that the features we added are not particularly helpful in the prediction, despite our intuition for how they could influence the selling price.\n",

This is the highest R-squared score and lowest MSE score that we have observed from the four models, suggesting that it is the best model. That being said, its performance is comparable to the performance of the model using only outlier removal (and not feature engineering), since the scores of the model with outlier removal are within one standard deviation of the scores of this model. This is in line with our previous finding that our feature engineering did not have a very large impact. However, it does appear to slightly improve the regression, so we choose this model as the best system.\n",

Note that the test MSE score is more than double the validation MSE score. Although some decline in the performance on the test set is expected (since we are comparing performance on unseen data with performance on data that the model was trained with), this is a particularly large drop in the performance on the test set. We believe that this is due to overfitting; more specifically, as we explained in the EDA and Outlier Detection section, we believe that the outliers detected by LOF are mainly novelties as opposed to errors. Since the chosen model removes these outliers, it performs well on training data without them. However, because similar values likely exist in the test set, the model is not trained to handle them, meaning that it does not generalize well to unseen data. Thus, the model overfits to a limited representation of the \"real\" data."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our empirical study, we successfully performed linear regression to predict selling prices of used cars from the `Vehicle Dataset` on Kaggle. We compared the performance of four models, which gave us insight on how outlier detection and feature engineering can influence linear regression. Although at first glance it appeared that outlier detection and removal improved the model, we found that due to the nature of the outliers (being novelties), the outlier removal led to overfitting and problems with generalization to the test set. We learned that it can be difficult to handle outliers as we must consider the potential consequences on unseen data. To future extend this analysis, we could try using ridge regression, which can help lessen overfitting by trying to handle issues with multicollinearity between predictors."
