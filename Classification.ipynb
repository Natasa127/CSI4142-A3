Note that we will be presenting each of the ten validity checks, although they may be in a different order than in assignment 2. They will be clearly enumerated.

    "We believe that despite our efforts to alter our near duplicate checker to identify rows that vary only by `customerID`, these rows **should not be removed.** There are a few reasons for this:\n",

    "- There is no row that occurs more than 3 times; in essence, there is no row that occurs a completely unreasonable number of times (there is only one row that occurs three times, and the rest occur twice).\n",
    "- Given that there are 7043 customers, 22 customers having the same information is plausible. There are a couple reasons why.\n",
    "    - This is a relatively small portion of the overall sample.\n",
    "    - Unlike the example in the course slides of near duplicates, we do not have a column like `Name` that would be highly likely to be distinct. All of the columns are reasonably likely to overlap.\n",
    "        - There are not many options for each column. All of the categorical values only provide a few options, and in many cases the same value would occur across multiple columns (ex: `No internet service` would be shared across 6 columns, so it effectively reduces the number of columns that could be a differentiator). Even the numerical columns are not particularly surprising to overlap—since they represent the prices of services, and presumably `Telco` offers a discrete set of services, the minimal duplication is expected.\n",
    "    - We analyzed all 22 rows that are duplicates, and the values are values that are logically more likely to be repeated; for example, all the customers had a tenure of 1 month, have a month-to-month plan, no dependents, no partner, were (mostly) not seniors, did not have multiple lines, and most of them do not purchase the internet service. Even of those that did purchase the internet service, none of them had any of the packages creating an unlikely combination. These are all relatively common values, and the internet service specifically reduces the number of differentiating columns. Thus, these users with a common service can only be differentiated by demographic information, their payment methods, and their churn, and it is likely that in some cases this would overlap.\n",
    "        - As an illustrative example, if there were 15 people with a tenure of exactly 42 months, and had a very specific combination of internet packages, then it would be more likely they were duplicates.\n",
    "        - To analyze the values of near duplicates, change `invalid_exact_duplicate_df.head(3)` to `invalid_exact_duplicate_df.head(22)`. We have left only 3 examples for brevity.\n",

    "#### Validity Check 10: Range Check\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the range check from `Assignment 2` to validate that the values of the numerical values are within the minimum and maximum acceptable values. Minimal changes are necessary to the code. Instead of taking a parameter input, we define a dictionary containing the relevant features as the keys, and their respective minimum and maximum values as values (stored as a tuple, (`min`, `max`)). Then, we iterate over all of these features and check if their values are within the designated range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a rationale for each of the ranges provided:\n",
    "- `tenure` [0, 900]: `Telco` is a fictitious company, so there is no real founding date. Let us suppose that `Telco` is a legacy telecommunications company, established in 1950. Then, the maximum `tenure` possible would be `900` months. A `tenure` cannot be negative, so the minimum is `0`, representing customers in their first month of service.\n",
    "- `MonthlyCharges` [5, 297]: Since `Telco` is a fictious company, there is not a set of services that can be checked to determine minimum and maximum values. From some industry research, we found a company that offers a home phone service for `5` dollars, so we will set the minimum monthly charge to `5` dollars. We are setting the maximum based on Bell's current maximum home phone price plus Bell's maximum internet service price, which is (`137` (Home Phone with Five Lines) + `160` (Gigabit Fibe 8.0)). Technically customers could buy more than five phone lines, but this estimate should be sufficient for this assignment.\n",
    "- `TotalCharges` [0, 267300]: The minimum `TotalCharges` is the minimum `tenure` multiplied by the minimum `MonthlyCharges`, which is `0` due to a possible `tenure` of `0`. The maximum `TotalCharges` is based on the maximum `tenure` multiplied by the maximum `MonthlyCharges`, which is `267300`.\n",
