Note that we will be presenting each of the ten validity checks, although they may be in a different order than in assignment 2. They will be clearly enumerated. Furthermore, in `Assignment 2`, we saved a copy of the invalid rows in our validity checks. In this assignment, we will first check the count of invalid rows; if there are none, we will omit the code that saves a copy, and displays invalid rows.

    "We believe that despite our efforts to alter our near duplicate checker to identify rows that vary only by `customerID`, these rows **should not be removed.** There are a few reasons for this:\n",

    "- There is no row that occurs more than 3 times; in essence, there is no row that occurs a completely unreasonable number of times (there is only one row that occurs three times, and the rest occur twice).\n",
    "- Given that there are 7043 customers, 22 customers having the same information is plausible. There are a couple reasons why.\n",
    "    - This is a relatively small portion of the overall sample.\n",
    "    - Unlike the example in the course slides of near duplicates, we do not have a column like `Name` that would be highly likely to be distinct. All of the columns are reasonably likely to overlap.\n",
    "        - There are not many options for each column. All of the categorical values only provide a few options, and in many cases the same value would occur across multiple columns (ex: `No internet service` would be shared across 6 columns, so it effectively reduces the number of columns that could be a differentiator). Even the numerical columns are not particularly surprising to overlap—since they represent the prices of services, and presumably `Telco` offers a discrete set of services, the minimal duplication is expected.\n",
    "    - We analyzed all 22 rows that are duplicates, and the values are values that are logically more likely to be repeated; for example, all the customers had a tenure of 1 month, have a month-to-month plan, no dependents, no partner, were (mostly) not seniors, did not have multiple lines, and most of them do not purchase the internet service. Even of those that did purchase the internet service, none of them had any of the packages creating an unlikely combination. These are all relatively common values, and the internet service specifically reduces the number of differentiating columns. Thus, these users with a common service can only be differentiated by demographic information, their payment methods, and their churn, and it is likely that in some cases this would overlap.\n",
    "        - As an illustrative example, if there were 15 people with a tenure of exactly 42 months, and had a very specific combination of internet packages, then it would be more likely they were duplicates.\n",
    "        - To analyze the values of near duplicates, change `invalid_exact_duplicate_df.head(3)` to `invalid_exact_duplicate_df.head(22)`. We have left only 3 examples for brevity.\n",

    "#### Validity Check 10: Range Check\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the range check from `Assignment 2` to validate that the values of the numerical values are within the minimum and maximum acceptable values. Minimal changes are necessary to the code. Instead of taking a parameter input, we define a dictionary containing the relevant features as the keys, and their respective minimum and maximum values as values (stored as a tuple, (`min`, `max`)). Then, we iterate over all of these features and check if their values are within the designated range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a rationale for each of the ranges provided:\n",
    "- `tenure` [0, 900]: `Telco` is a fictitious company, so there is no real founding date. Let us suppose that `Telco` is a legacy telecommunications company, established in 1950. Then, the maximum `tenure` possible would be `900` months. A `tenure` cannot be negative, so the minimum is `0`, representing customers in their first month of service.\n",
    "- `MonthlyCharges` [5, 297]: Since `Telco` is a fictious company, there is not a set of services that can be checked to determine minimum and maximum values. From some industry research, we found a company that offers a home phone service for `5` dollars, so we will set the minimum monthly charge to `5` dollars. We are setting the maximum based on Bell's current maximum home phone price plus Bell's maximum internet service price, which is (`137` (Home Phone with Five Lines) + `160` (Gigabit Fibe 8.0)). Technically customers could buy more than five phone lines, but this estimate should be sufficient for this assignment.\n",
    "- `TotalCharges` [0, 267300]: The minimum `TotalCharges` is the minimum `tenure` multiplied by the minimum `MonthlyCharges`, which is `0` due to a possible `tenure` of `0`. The maximum `TotalCharges` is based on the maximum `tenure` multiplied by the maximum `MonthlyCharges`, which is `267300`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Decision trees can benefit from binning numerical features. Our professor often references `Samy Baladram` articles in our lecture notes, so we will be following his guide to discretization, linked in our references. There are two methods he mentions in this article that we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Equal-Frequency-Binning (Quantile Binning):** This approach creates bins that contain roughly the same number of observations, which is good when you want to make sure the representation of data is balanced. This ensures decision boundaries are meaningful. <br>\n",
    "**2. Custom Binning:** This approach allows you to create bins based on domain knowledge. In our case this is useful because we can group `tenure` by the number of years, a logical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will bin the three numerical features as follows:\n",
    "- `tenure`: We will use **custom binning** for tenure, as a logical way to bin `tenure` is based on the number of years the customer has been with the company. We will divide `tenure` into 3 bins. Note that we chose these bin ranges, as they provide a roughly even distribution of the data, so we are still roughly adhering to **equal-frequency-binning** as well.\n",
    "    - `Short`: The customer has been with the company for under 12 months. (`2069` customers)\n",
    "    - `Medium`: The customer has been with the company between 12 and 48 months. (`2671` customers)\n",
    "    - `Long`: The customer has been with the company for more than 48 months. (`2303` customers)\n",
    "- `MonthlyCharges`: There is not a logical custom way to bin the monthly charges, so we will simply bin based on quantile, which uses the **Quantile Binning** approach. We will divide `MonthlyCharges` into 3 bins, based on their tertile.\n",
    "    - `Low`: The customer's `MonthlyCharges` value is in the first tertile.\n",
    "    - `Medium`: The customer's `MonthlyCharges` value is in the second tertile.\n",
    "    - `High`: The customer's `MonthlyCharges` value is in the third tertile.\n",
    "- `TotalCharges`: There is not a logical custom way to bin the total charges, so we will simply bin based on quantile, which uses the **Quantile Binning** approach. We will divide `TotalCharges` into 3 bins, based on their tertile.\n",
    "    - `Low`: The customer's `TotalCharges` value is in the first tertile.\n",
    "    - `Medium`: The customer's `TotalCharges` value is in the second tertile.\n",
    "    - `High`: The customer's `TotalCharges` value is in the third tertile.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a copy of the dataframe where we store the binned data. We do not replace the numerical data, as it will be used later for outlier removal and feature extraction. Thus, new features are created for the binned data, called `binned_tenure`, `binned_MonthlyCharges`, and `binned_TotalCharges` respectively. The original numerical data will be dropped after feature extraction, before the model training.\n",

    "Before moving on to parts c through e, we must do the first step of part f—splitting the data into a training set and a test set. This is important, as we do not want to remove outliers from or add features to the test set. We should only be modifying the training set. We will perform the split on the binned DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We split the data such that 80% is used for the training set, and the remaining 20% is reserved as the test set. As mentioned above, the modifications done to the data to train different versions of the model (outlier removal and feature extraction) will only be done on the training sets. After making the modifications to the training data, we will perform 4-fold cross-validation on the modified training sets. This involves creating 4 validation sets from the modified training sets. Ultimately, we do not separate a validation set in this step, as specified by the professor.\n",

To do so, we will print the value counts of the categories for each categorical feature, since it is simple to implement, and it is useful verify there are no categories that are minimally represented."

We use the Freedman-Diaconis rule to determine the optimal number of bins.

    "There are clearly no outliers in the `tenure` data. The values are distributed relatively evenly; there are no extreme values that are isolated. The large counts of low and high tenure appear to be natural, as they represent new customers and very old customers respectively; if the company is about 72 months old, it would make sense that there is a large count of people who joined at the same time when the company was first founded. Another EDA method to determine if there are outliers is to use a boxplot. The boxplot will use the IQR to CONTINUE EDITING LATER TODO"

    "There are no outliers for the `MonthlyCharges` either. Similar to `tenure`, there are no extreme values that are clearly isolated. The distribution makes sense given the business logic as well. The spike around 20 dollars makes sense, as a significant number of customers will simply purchase the cheapest option. There are a lower amount of customers near 120, but a monthly payment near 120 is reasonable and expected—from our previous industry research, Bell has many internet plans that are more costly than 120 dollars. Given that there is still a fair number of customers near 120 dollars, a price near 120 dollars makes sense in the business context, and there are no gaps in the bars directly preceding the bar near 120 dollars (it is not isolated from the rest of the data), we conclude that there are no outliers in the `MonthlyCharges`. We move on to visualizing `TotalCharges` next."

    "The histogram of `TotalCharges` shows a right-skewed distribution, but there do not seem to be outliers. There are no data points that differ significantly from their neighbours; there are no isolated bars, and it is a very steady decline. From a business context, it also makes sense that as more customers have lower `tenure` and lower `MonthlyCharges`, the `TotalCharges` counts would gradually decline as the `TotalCharges` increase. Furthermore, the actual value of a little over 8000 dollars would make sense for customers that have been paying a little over a hundred dollars a month for the full 72 months. Let us show some example rows to determine if these large values are natural."
